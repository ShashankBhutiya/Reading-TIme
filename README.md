# Reading-TIme
Version 1.0: This is a Chrome extension which Determines the approx reading time and diplay the reading time near the title of the article or blog on the webpage. Works best on Chrome for develeoper website. Might not work on few website which are not well structured or not meant to be a article. This is one of my small project for learing purpose.
